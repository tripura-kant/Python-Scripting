# Given a checkParity(n) function, write code to determine if a given number n is even or odd.
# Think of this as a function that returns 0 if the number is even, and 1 if it is odd.
# You have been given some starter code where the function and return statement have already been written,
# so donâ€™t worry about any Python-specific details about functions; just implement the function logic!

def checkParity(n):
  ## Write your code here
  result = (n % 2)
  return result

print(checkParity(10))
